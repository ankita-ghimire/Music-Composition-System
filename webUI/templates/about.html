            <p class="lead">
                This project is an exploration into the intersection of music and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to provide a tool that is both a creative partner for seasoned musicians and an accessible entry point for newcomers to compose their own melodies and harmonies.

            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Melody Generation:</strong> Our AI generates melodies using a Markov chain model. It has been trained on a dataset of musical pieces to learn the probabilities of which notes are likely to follow one another, creating sequences that are both novel and musically coherent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Chord Generation:</strong> For every melody, the system provides a harmonically rich foundation. It generates chord progressions based on fundamental principles of music theory, ensuring that the chords perfectly complement the key and mode of the generated melody.
